        San Fernando is a Philippines city in Pampanga province, northwest of
        Manila. Itâ€™s known for its Giant Lantern Festival, with traditional
        Christmas parol lanterns. The railway station, now a museum, was the end
        point of the WWII Bataan Death March. The Archdiocesan Museum and
        Archives has religious and cultural artifacts. To the northeast, the
        Candaba Wetlands attract rare bird species.
